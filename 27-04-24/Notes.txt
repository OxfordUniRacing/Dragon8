Must send control word 0xFF for anything to happen


Found this extended diagnostics page:
	https://zeromanual.com/wiki/Gen2/Motor_Controller/CAN_Diagnostics
	Got 0x52C3 error code (Current Control Fault)  when spinning the motor when "active'
		Means that the inverter had no control over the current through the inverter (not neccessarily overcurrent)
		However, the powersupply overcurrent did also trip
		CAN Diagnostics page inidicate to check both:
			Motor load and wiring (pretty confident its correct)
			controller programming (confident it isn't correct)
